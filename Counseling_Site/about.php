    		<p>Oregon State University - Cascades offers free counseling to community members through the university&#39s graduate counseling clinic. The counseling sessions provide a community service and allow master&#39s students to implement and develop expertise under the close supervision of faculty and clinical supervisors.

			Sessions are facilitated by graduate students who are trained in cognitive&#45behavioral therapies that are shown to be effective in helping individuals manage stress, anxiety, depression and trauma.

			Community counseling is offered in Bend at the Graduate & Research Center near the Old Mill District.</p>
